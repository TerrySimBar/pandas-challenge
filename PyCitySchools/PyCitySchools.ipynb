    "# PyCity Schools Analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "This report includes:\n",
    "\n",
    "- A summary of the analysis performed\n",
    "\n",
    "- Two important comparisons from the calculations\n",
    "\n",
    "- Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "- Recommendations for further investigations\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "This project explored various educational metrics and performance indicators for the PyCity School District using data which includes information on student performance in both math and reading. Data was also provided about the schools in the District: size, budget, and type (charter or district). This analysis seeks to gain insights about individual school performance and identify trends that can inform decision-making to improve student outcomes. \n",
    "\n",
    "##### Metrics and Indicators:\n",
    "The key metrics and performance indicators that have been analyzed in each school and/or the District includes:\n",
    "\n",
    "- The total number of students \n",
    "\n",
    "- The average math and reading score\n",
    "\n",
    "- The total number of students passing math and/or reading\n",
    "\n",
    "- The District, school, and individual student budget\n",
    "\n",
    "- The top and bottom performing schools based on test scores\n",
    "\n",
    "- Math and reading scores by grade\n",
    "\n",
    "- Scores by school spending\n",
    "\n",
    "- Scores by school size\n",
    "\n",
    "- Scores by school type \n",
    "\n",
    "- District summary\n",
    "\n",
    "- School summaries such as by type, size, spending, and test scores\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Methodology:\n",
    "The methodology includes:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Descriptive statistics: Calculating means, percentages, sum and other summary statistics for the key metrics.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Comparative analysis: Comparing school performance based on different metrics (e.g. scores by school type, size, spending, and performamce in math and reading). \n",
    "\n",
    "- Correlation analysis: Examining potential relationships between metrics (e.g., correlation between school type and student performance).\n",
    "\n",
    "- Data visualization: Analyses are presented as tables\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Comparisons:\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Impact of School Size on Academic Performance:\n",
    "The analysis suggests that smaller schools, with fewer than 2000 students, tend to have higher performance in math and/or reading scores  compared to larger-sized schools. It could be that smaller schools may provide a more conducive learning environment with a lower teacher to student ratio that allows for more individual attention and support to students. As school size increases, there might be challenges in maintaining the same level of individualized attention, or other factors such as larger staff to mamage, that could potentially lead to lower academic performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Differences Between Charter and District Schools:\n",
    "The analysis also indicates that charter schools, on average, have higher passing rates in both math and reading compared to district schools. The charter school model and culture might be more effective in promoting academic achievement and supporting students to meet proficiency levels. District schools may have systems and practices that relate to lower academics. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Conclusion \n",
    "School size and type are likely key factors that influence academic performance, with smaller schools and charter schools showing higher average scores and passing rates. However, further investigation is needed to understand the underlying reasons behind these differences and to make informed decisions for school improvement and resource allocation.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Recommendations for Further Investigations\n",
    "Investigate how teaching methods and curricula alignment with educational standards in different schools affect academic performance, to identify effective practices and increase student learning outcomes.\n",
    "\n",
    "Explore the role of extracurricular activities in students' academic performance and overall development. \n",
    "\n",
    "Investigate how parental involvement correlates with student achievement.\n",
    "\n",
    "Examine how student demographics, including factors like socio-economic status, ethnicity, and language proficiency relate to academic performance. \n",
    "\n",
    "Investigate the relationship between teacher-to-student ratios and academic performance."
